    "content": "Specializing in RecSys, Knowledge Graphs, and GCNs, I am a Master's student in Information Management. With extensive full-stack experience, I value the engineering mindset that turns abstract theory into reliable implementations.<br />When building Deep Learning architectures, I care not only about model accuracy but also about stability in real-world production. By integrating Python workflows with Node.js backends, I independently build end-to-end systems from data analysis to deployment.",
